## Password Generator 
# Description
Throughout this project many additions to the original Javascript starter code were made. The purpose of these changes were to create a working password generator. In order for this to be accomplished I had to add prompts for password criteria such as length of characters, if uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers and symbols.
